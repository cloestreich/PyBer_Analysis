# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of PyBer
The purpose of the PyBer analysis is to see the amount of rides and drivers in the urban, suburban, and rural settings.  It's also intended to compare the fare amounts between the three different settings.

# Results
Looking at the data, it looks like fare amounts in the rural setting are the most expensive (see attached png file).  Fare amounts in the urban setting are least expensive.  Fare amounts in the suburban setting fall between the urban and rural fare amounts.  This is likely due to the fact that there aren't as many drivers in the rural setting, thus the fare amount is going to be more expensive.  The urban setting has most drivers, making for more competition and lower rates.  To break this down: the rural setting only has 78 total drivers and the average fare per driver is $55.49.  In the suburban setting, there are 490 total drivers and an average fare of $39.50.  In the urban setting, there are 2,405 total drivers with an average fare of $16.57.

# Summary
Here are three recommendations for the CEO to address the disparities between the three city types:
- Lowering the rates of the rural rides slightly could drive up the amount of rides given.
- Since the demand is there in the urban setting, raising the prices a little bit on urban rides could drive up revenue.
- Keeping the suburban ride amounts between the urban and rural settings is a smart move.
